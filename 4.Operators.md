## Operators

Python Arthimetic Operators

Operator | Functionality
--|--
+ | Addition
- | Subtraction
* | Multiplication
/ | Divison
% | Modulus
** | Exponentiation
// | Floor division

Python Assignment Operators

Operator | Example | Same As
--|--|-- 
= | x = 5 | x = 5
+= | x += 5 | x = x + 5
-= | x -= 5 | x = x - 5
*= | x *= 5 | x = x * 5
/= | x /= 5 | x = x / 5
%= | x %= 5 | x = x % 5
//= | x //= 5 | x = x // 5
**= | x **= 5 | x = x ** 5
&= | x &= 5 | x = x & 3
^= | x ^= 3	| x = x ^ 3	
>>=	| x >>= 3	| x = x >> 3	
<<=	| x <<= 3	| x = x << 3

Python Comparision Operators

Operator | Functionality
--|--
== | Equal
!= | Not Equal
> | Greater than
< | Less than
>= | Greater than or equal to
<= | Less than or equal to

Python Logical Operators

Operator | Functionality
--|--
and | Returns True if both statements are true.
or | Returns True if one of the statements is true.
not | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true.

Python Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory.

Operator | Functionality | Example
--|--|--
is | Returns True if both variables are the same object  |  x is y
is not | Returns True if both variables are not the same object | x is not y

Python Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.

Operator | Functionality
--|--
in | Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object.
not in | Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object.

Python Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers

Operator | Name | Description
--|--|--
& | AND | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
`|` | OR | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^ | XOR | Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~ | NOT | Inverts all the bits
<< | Zero fill left shif | Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>> | Signed right shift | Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
