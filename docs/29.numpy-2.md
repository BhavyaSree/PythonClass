## NumPy Array Copy vs View

The main difference between a copy and a view of an array is that the copy is a new array, and the view is just a view of the original array.

The copy owns the data and any changes made to the copy will not affect original array, and any changes made to the original array will not affect the copy.

The view does not own the data and any changes made to the view will affect the original array, and any changes made to the original array will affect the view.

!!! Example "Copy"

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    x = arr.copy()
    arr[0] = 42

    print(arr)
    >>> [42  2  3  4  5]
    print(x)
    >>> [1 2 3 4 5]
    ```

The copy SHOULD NOT be affected by the changes made to the original array.

!!! Example "View"

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    x = arr.view()
    arr[0] = 42

    print(arr)
    >>> [42  2  3  4  5]
    print(x)
    >>> [42  2  3  4  5]
    ```

The view SHOULD be affected by the changes made to the original array.
The original array SHOULD be affected by the changes made to the view.

### Check if Array Owns it's Data

As mentioned above, copies owns the data, and views does not own the data, but how can we check this?
Every NumPy array has the attribute base that returns None if the array owns the data.
Otherwise, the base  attribute refers to the original object.

!!! Example

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

x = arr.copy()
y = arr.view()

print(x.base)
>>> None
print(y.base)
>>> [1 2 3 4 5]
```

## NumPy Array Shape

The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.
NumPy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns a tuple with each index having the number of corresponding elements.

!!! Example "2-D Array"

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])

    print(arr.shape)
    >>> (2,4)
    ```

!!! Example "5-D Array"

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=5)

    print(arr)
    >>> [[[[[1 2 3 4]]]]]
    print(arr.shape)
    >>> (1, 1, 1, 1, 4)
    ```

## NumPy Array Reshaping

Reshaping means changing the shape of an array.
The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.
By reshaping we can add or remove dimensions or change number of elements in each dimension.

!!! Example "Reshape from 1-D to 2-D"

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
    newarr = arr.reshape(4, 3)

    print(newarr)
    >>> [[ 1  2  3]
        [ 4  5  6]
        [ 7  8  9]
        [10 11 12]]
    ```

!!! Example "Reshape from 1-D to 3-D"

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
    newarr = arr.reshape(2, 3, 2)

    print(newarr)
    >>> [[[ 1  2]
        [ 3  4]
        [ 5  6]]

        [[ 7  8]
        [ 9 10]
        [11 12]]]
    ```

!!! Note
    "We can reshape the array into any shape as long as the elements required for reshaping are equal in both shapes."

### Returns Copy or View?

!!! Example

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
    print(arr.reshape(2, 4).base)
    >>> [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
    ```
The example above returns the original array, so it is a view.

### Unknown Dimension

We are allowed to have one "unknown" dimension.
Meaning that we do not have to specify an exact number for one of the dimensions in the reshape method.
Pass -1 as the value, and NumPy will calculate this number.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
    newarr = arr.reshape(2, -1)
    print(newarr)
    >>> [[[1 2]
        [3 4]]

        [[5 6]
        [7 8]]]
    ```
We can not pass -1 to more than one dimension.

### Flattening the arrays

Flattening array means converting a multidimensional array into a 1D array.
We can use reshape(-1) to do this.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    newarr = arr.reshape(-1)
    print(newarr)
    >>> [1 2 3 4 5 6]
    ```

## NumPy Array Iterating

In basic for loops, iterating through each scalar of an array we need to use n for loops which can be difficult to write for arrays with very high dimensionality.

### Iterating Arrays Using nditer()

The function `nditer()` is a helping function that can be used from very basic to very advanced iterations.

#### Iterating on Each Scalar Element

!!! Example

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    arr = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
    for x in np.nditer(arr):
    print(x)

    >>> 1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
    ```

#### Iterating With Different Step Size

!!! Example

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])

    for x in np.nditer(arr[:, ::2]):
    print(x)

    >>> 1
        3
        5
        7
    ```

#### Enumerated Iteration Using ndenumerate()

Enumeration means mentioning sequence number of somethings one by one.
Sometimes we require corresponding index of the element while iterating, the `ndenumerate()` method can be used for those usecases.

!!! Example "For 1-D Array"

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])

    for idx, x in np.ndenumerate(arr):
    print(idx, x)

    >>> (0,) 1
        (1,) 2
        (2,) 3
    ```

!!! Example "For 2-D Array"

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])

    for idx, x in np.ndenumerate(arr):
    print(idx, x)

    >>> (0, 0) 1
        (0, 1) 2
        (0, 2) 3
        (0, 3) 4
        (1, 0) 5
        (1, 1) 6
        (1, 2) 7
        (1, 3) 8
    ```

## NumPy Joining Array

Joining means putting contents of two or more arrays in a single array.
In SQL we join tables based on a key, whereas in NumPy we join arrays by axes.
We pass a sequence of arrays that we want to join to the `concatenate()` function, along with the axis. If axis is not explicitly passed, it is taken as 0.
(axis-0 represents rows and axis-1 represents columns)

!!! Example "Join two 1-D Arrays"

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    arr = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2))

    print(arr)
    >>> [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    ```

!!! Example "Join two 2-D Arrays"

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    arr2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    arr = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2), axis=1)

    print(arr)
    >>> [[1 2 5 6]
        [3 4 7 8]]
    ```

### Joining Arrays Using Stack Functions

Stacking is same as concatenation, the only difference is that stacking is done along a new axis.
We can concatenate two 1-D arrays along the second axis which would result in putting them one over the other, ie. stacking.
We pass a sequence of arrays that we want to join to the concatenate() method along with the axis. If axis is not explicitly passed it is taken as 0.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    arr = np.stack((arr1, arr2), axis=1)

    print(arr)
    >>> [[1 4]
        [2 5]
        [3 6]]
    ```

### Row Wise Stacking

`hstack()` to stack along rows.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    arr = np.hstack((arr1, arr2))

    print(arr)
    >>> [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    ```

### Column Wise stacking

`vstack()` to stack along rows.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    arr = np.vstack((arr1, arr2))

    print(arr)
    >>> [[1 2 3]
        [4 5 6]]
    ```
