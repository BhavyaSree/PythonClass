        if word[0] == 's':  
            print(word)  
    ```

!!! question "2. Use range() to print all the even numbers from 0 to 10."

        if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif num % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif num % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(num)
