## Object Oriented

In python, Programmers can create their own objects that have methods and attributes.

In general, Object Oriented programming allows us to create a code that is repeatable and organized.

Class is like an object constructor or a "blueprint" for creating objects.  

!!! example "Create a Class"  

    ``` python
    class myclass:  
      x = 10 
    ```
We can use class myclass to create objects

!!! example "Create a Object"

    Creating the object o1 and print the value of x

    ```python
    o1 = myclass()
    print(o1.x)
    >>> 10
    ```

### The `__init__()` function

In order to understand the meaning of classes and how objects can be created using classes, we need to understand the built-in `__init__()` function.

All classes will have `__init__()` function, which will be executed when the class is being initiated.
This `__init__()` function assign properties of a class to the object.

!!! example  

    ```python
    class Person:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    p1 = Person("Bhavya", 29)

    print(p1.name)
    print(p1.age)

    >>> Bhavya
    >>> 29
    ```
