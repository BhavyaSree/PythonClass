Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index.  

## pandas.series

`pandas.Series( data, index, dtype, copy)`

!!! Example "Create an empty series"

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    s = pd.Series()
    print s
    >>> Series([], dtype: float64)
    ```

### Create a Series from ndarray

If data is an ndarray, then index passed must be of the same length. If no index is passed, then by default index will be range(n) where n is array length, i.e., [0,1,2,3â€¦. range(len(array))-1].

!!! Example

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    data = np.array(['a','b','c','d'])
    s = pd.Series(data)
    print(s)

    >>> 0   a
        1   b
        2   c
        3   d
        dtype: object
    ```

    We did not pass any index, so by default, it assigned the indexes ranging from 0 to len(data)-1, i.e., 0 to 3.

!!! Example 

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    data = np.array(['a','b','c','d'])
    s = pd.Series(data,index=[100,101,102,103])
    print(s)
    >>> 100  a
        101  b
        102  c
        103  d
        dtype: object
    ```

    We passed the index values here. Now we can see the customized indexed values in the output.

### Create a Series from dict

A dict can be passed as input and if no index is specified, then the dictionary keys are taken in a sorted order to construct index. If index is passed, the values in data corresponding to the labels in the index will be pulled out.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    data = {'a' : 0., 'b' : 1., 'c' : 2.}
    s = pd.Series(data)
    print(s)
    >>> a 0.0
        b 1.0
        c 2.0
        dtype: float64
    ```
    Dictionary keys are used to construct index.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    data = {'a' : 0., 'b' : 1., 'c' : 2.}
    s = pd.Series(data,index=['b','c','d','a'])
    print(s)
    >>> b 1.0
        c 2.0
        d NaN
        a 0.0
        dtype: float64
    ```
    Index order is persisted and the missing element is filled with NaN (Not a Number).

### Create a series from scaler

If data is a scalar value, an index must be provided. The value will be repeated to match the length of index.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    s = pd.Series(5, index=[0, 1, 2, 3])
    print(s)
    >>> 0  5
        1  5
        2  5
        3  5
        dtype: int64
    ```

### Accessing Data from Series with Position

Data in the series can be accessed similar to that in an ndarray.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    s = pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5],index = ['a','b','c','d','e'])

    #retrieve the first element
    print(s[0])
    >>> 1
    #retrieve the first three element
    print(s[:3])
    >>> a  1
        b  2
        c  3
        dtype: int64
    #retrieve the last three element
    print(s[-3:])
    >>> c  3
        d  4
        e  5
        dtype: int64
    ```

### Retrieve Data Using Label (Index)

A Series is like a fixed-size dict in that you can get and set values by index label.

!!! Example

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    s = pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5],index = ['a','b','c','d','e'])

    #retrieve a single element
    print(s['a'])
    >>> 1
    #retrieve multiple elements
    print(s[['a','c','d']])
    >>> a  1
        c  3
        d  4
        dtype: int64
    print(s['f'])
    >>> KeyError: 'f'
    ```
