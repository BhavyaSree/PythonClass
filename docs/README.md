## Quick Intro

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) was developed by [Guido Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in 1991. 

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language.

!!! success "INTERPRETED"
    This language uses an interpreter to change the code to machine language.  
!!! success "OBJECT-ORIENTED"
    This language is designed around objects. Objects are nothing but data fields that has a unique attributes and behavior.  
!!! success "High level language"
    Programmers can easily understand, or interpret or compile the high level programming langugae comparing to machine. 
    **Example**: C, C++, Java, Python 

!!! quote "Low level language"
    **Low level language** - Machine can understand the low level language compared to humans.  
    **Examples**: Machine language or Assembly language.
    machine language in the sense, everything will be in binary.

* Python is a case sensitive language.

* Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000
* Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008.


## Zen of Python

!!! note "The principles are listed as follows:"

    * Beautiful is better than ugly.
    * Explicit is better than implicit.
    * Simple is better than complex.
    * Complex is better than complicated.
    * Flat is better than nested.
    * Sparse is better than dense.
    * Readability counts.
    * Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    * Although practicality beats purity.
    * Errors should never pass silently.
    * Unless explicitly silenced.
    * In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    * There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.
    * Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    * Now is better than never.
    * Although never is often better than right now.
    * If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    * If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    * Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!
