The key function for working with files in Python is the `open()` function.

The `open()` function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:

* **"r"** - Read - Default value  
  Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist.
* **"a"** - Append  
  Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist.
* **"w"** - Write  
  Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist.
* **"x"** - Create  
  Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

In addition to these, we can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode.

* **"t"** - Text - Default value
* **"b"** - Binary - Binary mode

!!! example " To open a file for reading"

    ```python
    f = open("test.txt")

    or

    f = open("demofile.txt", "r")

    or 

    f = open("demofile.txt", "rt")
    ```

### Read the File

The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file.

Suppose I have file test.txt with the below text

!!! Note "test.txt"

    This is a Python class.  
    This file is for testing purpose.


!!! example

    ```python
    f = open("test.txt", "r")
    print(f.read())

    Output:
    This is a Python class.  
    This file is for testing purpose.
    ```

If the file is available in the different location, we need to specify the path.

!!! example

    ```python
    f = open("D:\\myfiles\test.txt", "r")
    print(f.read())
    ```

#### Read only parts of the File

By default read() method returns the whole text, but we can also specify how many characters we want to return.

!!! example 

    ```python
    f = open("test.txt", "r")
    print(f.read(5))

    Output:
    This 
    ```

#### Read Lines

We can return one line by using readline() method.

!!! example

    ```python
    f = open("test.txt", "r")
    print(f.readline())

    Output:
    This is a Python class.
    ```

To read multiple lines, we need to call readline() method multiple times.

!!! example

    ```python
    f = open("test.txt", "r")
    print(f.readline())
    print(f.readline())

    Output:
    This is a Python class.
    This file is for testing purpose.
    ```

By looping through the lines of the file, we can read the whole file, line by line.

!!! example

    ```python
    f = open("test.txt", "r")
    for x in f:
      print(x)

    Output:
    This is a Python class.
    This file is for testing purpose.
    ```

### Close the File.

We need to close the file, when we are done using the file.

!!! example "Closing the file"

    ```python
    f = open("test.txt", "r")
    print(f.readline())
    f.close()

    Output:
    This is a Python class
    ```

### Write to an Existing File

In order to write to an existing File, we need to mention "a" (to append) or "w" (to overwrite) as a parameter to the open() function.

!!! example

    ```python
    f = open("test.txt", "a")
    f.write("\nNow the file has more content!")
    f.close()

    #open and read the file after the appending:
    f = open("test.txt", "r")
    print(f.read())

    Output:
    This is a Python class.
    This file is for testing purpose.
    Now the file has more content!
    ```

"w" parameter will overwrite the whole content of the file

!!! example

    ```python
    f = open("test.txt", "w")
    f.write("Woops! I have deleted the content!")
    f.close()

    #open and read the file after the appending:
    f = open("test.txt", "r")
    print(f.read())
    ```
    Output:       
    Woops! I have deleted the content!

## Create a New File

In order to create a file, we need to add "x" (to create) or "a" (to create, if the file does not exist) or "w" (to create, if the file does not exist).

!!! example

    ```python
    f = open("test1.txt", "x")
    ```
    A new empty file will be created.

## Delete a File

To delete a file, we must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function.

!!! example

    ```python
    import os

    os.remove("test1.txt")
    ```

If the file does not exists, os.remove() will throw an error.

### Check if File exist

To avoid getting an error, we can check if the file exists before we try to delete it

!!! example

    ```python
    import os

    if os.path.exists("test.txt"):
      os.remove("test.txt")
    else:
      print("The file does not exist")
    ```

### Delete Folder

To delete an entire folder, use the os.rmdir() method.

!!! example

    ```python
    import os
    os.rmdir("myfolder")
    ```

    This removes entire folder 'myfolder'
