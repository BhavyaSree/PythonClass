## If...else

If...else is the conditional statement to check for the condition and return the output based on the condition output.

Python relies on indentation to define the scope of the code.

### if

if statement is return using teh if keyboard.

!!! example
    ```python
    if a > b:
      print('a is greater than b)
    ```

### Elif 

elif keywords says that "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

!!! example
    ```python
    if a > b:
      print('a is greater than b)
    elif a == b:
      print('a is equal to b)
    ```

### Else

else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

!!! example
    ```python
    if a > b:
      print('a is greater than b)
    elif a == b:
      print('a is equal to b)
    else:
      print('a is less than b)
    ```

### Short Hand If

!!! example
    ```python
    if a > b: print('a is greater than b')
    ```

### Short Hand If...Else

!!! example
    ```python
    print("A") if a > b else print("B")

    print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
    ```

### Nested if

!!! example
    ```python
    if x > 10:
      print("Above ten,")
      if x > 20:
        print("and also above 20!")
      else:
        print("but not above 20.")
    ```

### Pass statement

When we don't have any operation to perform after checking the condition, we can use just pass keyword.

!!! example
    ```python
    if a > b:
      pass
    ```

## Loops

Python has two loop commands
* While loop
* For loop

## While Loop

We can execute set of commands or statements as long as the condition is true

!!! example
    ```python
    x = 1
    while (x < 5):
      print(x)
      x += 1
    ```

Break - stops the loop even if the while condition is true

!!! example
    ```python
    x = 1
    while (x < 5):
      print(x)
      if x == 3:
        break
      x += 1
    ```

continue - continue statement stops the current iteration and continues with the next

!!! example
    ```python
    x = 1
    while (x < 5):
      x += 1
      if x == 3:
        continue
      print(x)
    ```
## For Loop

For loop iterates over an object

!!! example
    ```python
    mylist = [1,2,3]
    for x in mylist:
      print (x)
    ```

break - breaks the loop before it has looped all the elements

!!! example
    ```python
    mylist = [1,2,3]
    for x in mylist:
      if x == 2:
        break
      print (x)
    ```

continue - stops the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next 

!!! example
    ```python
    mylist = [1,2,3]
    for x in mylist:
      if x == 2:
        continue
      print (x)
    ```

## Useful Built-in functions

### range function
range() - range function returns a sequence of numbers starting from 0 by default and increments by 1, and ends at a specific number

range(5) -- sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, excluding 5.
range(2,10,2)  -- first parameter will be start point, second indicates stop point, third indicates step size.

!!! example
    ```python
    mylist = list(range(5))
    mylist
    [0,1,2,3,4] 
    ```

#### Using for loop

!!! example
    ```python
    for x in range(2,6):
      print(x)
    ```

### enumerate

enumerate function adds counter to the iterable

!!! example
    ```python
    word = 'abcde'

    for item in enumerate(word):
      print item

    Result :
    (0,a)
    (1,b)
    (2,c)
    (3,d)
    (4,e)

    ```

!!! example
    ```python
    word = 'abcde'

    for item in enumerate(word, 2):
      print item

    Result :
    (2,a)
    (3,b)
    (4,c)
    (5,d)
    (6,e)
    ```

!!! example
    ```python
    word = 'abcde'

    for (index,letter) in enumerate(word):
      print index

    Result :
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4

    ```

### Zip function

Zip function returns a zip object. First iterable of the first object will be paired with first iterable of the second object.

!!! example
    ```python
    mylist1 = [1,2,3]
    mylist2 = [a,b,c]

    for item in zip(mylist1,mylist2):
      print (item)

    Result:
    (1,a)
    (2,b)
    (3,c)
    ```
## List Comprehensions

List Comprehensions is the way to define and create lists based on the existing lists

!!! example
    ```python
    myString = 'Hello'

    mylist = []

    for letter in myString:
        mylist.append(letter)

    print(mylist)
    ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
    ```

### Using List Comprehensions

!!! example
    ```python
    mylist = [x for x in 'word']

    print(mylist)
    ['w', 'o', 'r', 'd']
    ```

!!! example
    ```python
    mylist = [x for x in range(0,11) if x%2 == 0]

    print(mylist)
    [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    ```

!!! example
    ```python
    mylist = [x*y for x in [2,4,6] for y in [1,10,100]]

    print(mylist)
    [2, 20, 200, 4, 40, 400, 6, 60, 600]
    ```
