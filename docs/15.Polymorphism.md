## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the condition of occurrence in different forms.

!!! example "Opertators"

    For integer data types, `+` operator is used to perform arithmetic addition operation.  
    For string data types, `+` operator is used to perform concatenation.

    Thus `+` operator shows polymorphism in python.


!!! example "Functions"

    ```python
    print(len("Python"))
    print(len(["Python", "Java", "C"]))
    print(len({"Name": "Bhavya", "Age": "29"}))

    Result:
    6
    3
    2
    ```

### Class polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different classes to have methods with the same name. 

!!! example "Classes"

    ```python
    class Cat:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

        def info(self):
            print(f"I am a cat. My name is {self.name}. I am {self.age} years old.")

        def make_sound(self):
            print("Meow")


    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

        def info(self):
            print(f"I am a dog. My name is {self.name}. I am {self.age} years old.")

        def make_sound(self):
            print("Bark")


    cat1 = Cat("Kitty", 2.5)
    dog1 = Dog("Fluffy", 4)

    for animal in (cat1, dog1):
        animal.make_sound()
        animal.info()
        animal.make_sound()

    Result:
    Meow
    I am a cat. My name is Kitty. I am 2.5 years old.
    Meow
    Bark
    I am a dog. My name is Fluffy. I am 4 years old.
    Bark
    ```

In the above example, we have two classes Cat and Dog. They have similar structure and same method names info() and make_sound().

Though we are not linking these classes anywhere, we can pack the two different objects from two different classes as a tuple and iterate through it using a common animal variable. This is poosible due to the concept of polymorphism.
