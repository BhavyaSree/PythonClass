!!! question "1. Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere given its radius."
    The volume of a sphere is given as
    $$
    \frac{4}{3} Ï€r^3
    $$

!!! answer
    ```python
    def vol(rad):
        volume = (4/3)*3.14*rad*rad*rad
        print(volume)

    vol(2)
    ```


!!! question "2. Write a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (inclusive of high and low)"

!!! answer
    ```python
    def num_check(num,low,high):
        if num in range(low,high+1):
            print(f'{num} is in the range between {low} and {high}')
        else:
            print(f'{num} is out of range')

    num_check(5,2,7)
    ```

    To return only boolean value

    ```python
    def num_bool(num,low,high):
        return num in range(low,high+1)

    num_bool(5,2,7)
    ```

!!! question "3. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.

Sample List : [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

!!! question "4. Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.

Sample List : [1, 2, 3, -4]
Expected Output : -24

!!! question "5. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
Expected Output : 
No. of Upper case characters : 4
No. of Lower case Characters : 33
HINT: Two string methods that might prove useful: .isupper() and .islower()
