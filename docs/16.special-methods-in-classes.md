## SpeciaL Methods

We cannot use general built in functions on the classes.

!!! example "In the case of Lists"
    ```python
    mylist = [1,2,3]
    len(mylist)
    print(mylist)

    Output:
    3
    [1, 2, 3]
    ```

!!! example "In the case of Classes"
    ```python
    class sample():
        pass

    mysample = sample()
    len(mysample)

    print(mysample)

    Output:
    TypeError: object of type 'sample' has no len()
    <__main__.sample object at 0x7f84a10f2310>
    ```

### `__str__()` method

Special method __str__() will be defined in the classes to return string representation of the object.  
This method is called when print() or str() function is invoked on an object.

!!! example "Using `__str__()` method"

    ```python
    class book():
        
      def __init__(self,title,author):
            
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages
        
      def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author}"

    b = book('Python Classes','Bhavya')
    print(b)

    Output:
    Python Classes by Bhavya
    ```

### `__len__()` method

The len() function will attempt to call a method named `__len__()` in our class.

!!! example "Using `__len__()` method"

    ```python
    class book():
        
      def __init__(self,title,author,pages):
            
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages
            
      def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author}"
        
      def __len__(self):
        return self.pages

    b = book('Python Classes','Bhavya', 200)
    len(b)

    Output:
    200
    ```

### `__del__()` method

`__del__()` is a destructor method which is called as soon as all references of the object are deleted  i.e when an object is garbage collected.  
By using `del` keyword all references of object will be deleted and therefore destructor invoked automatically.

!!! example "Using `__del__()` method"

```python
class book():
    
  def __init__(self,title,author,pages):
        
    self.title = title
    self.author = author
    self.pages = pages
        
  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.title} by {self.author}"
    
  def __len__(self):
    return self.pages
    
  def __del__(self):
    print("A book object has been deleted")

  b = book('Python Classes','Bhavya', 200)
  del b

  Output:
  A book object has been deleted
```

!!! Note 
    These special methods are called as dunder methods "Double Under (Underscores)" which python will look for to perform special operations.
