## Inheritance

Inheritance allows us to define new classes using classes that have already been defined.

Child classes inherits all the methods and properties from the parent class.

Parent class is also called as base class. 
Child class is also called derived class.

Any class can be a parent class, that is we can derive the child classes from any class.  

### Create a Child Class

To create a class that inherits the functionality from the parent class, we need to pass the parent class as a parameter while creating the child class.

!!! example "Creating a child class from person class"

    ```python
    class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
      self.firstname = fname
      self.lastname = lname

    def printname(self):
      print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

    class Student(Person):
      pass

    x = Student("Bhavya", "Bindela")
    x.printname()

    Result:
    Bhavya Bindela
    ```

In the above example, student class will have the same properties and methods as the person class.

### `__init__()` function

As of now, Student class inherits the properties from the Person class. In order to add any properties to the Student class exclusively, we need to add __init__() function.

!!! example "Defining `__init__()` function in the derived class"

    ```python
    class Student(Person):
      def __init__(self, fname, lname):
          # we can add properties below
    ```

When you add the `__init__()` function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's `__init__()` function.

To keep the inheritance of the parent's `__init__()` function, add a call to the parent's `__init__()` function.

!!! example "Calling the parent's `__init__()` function"

    ```python
    class Student(Person):
      def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)
    ```

### Super() function

Super() function in python allows the child class to inherit all the properties and methods from it's parent class.

!!! example "Inherit the properties of parent class using super() function"

    ```python
    class Student(Person):
      def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
    ```

### Add properties in child class

As we are defining the initialize the function (constructor), we can add as many properties as needed.

!!! example "Add properties"

    ```python
    class Student(Person):
      def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
        self.graduationyear = 2020
    ```

In the above example, as graduation year changes from student to student, we want to make the year (2019) as a variable and pass this as a parameter to the student class. Then

!!! example "Adding parameters to the child class"

    ```python
    class Student(Person):
      def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
        self.graduationyear = year

      x = Student("Bhavya", "Bindela", 2020)
      print(x.graduationyear)

      Result:
      >> 2020
    ```

### Add Methods in child class

We can add the methods in child class, just like we add methods in normal classes.

!!! example "Adding methods"

    ```python
    class Student(Person):
      def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
        self.graduationyear = year

      def welcome(self):
        print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)

    x = Student("Bhavya", "Bindela", 2020)
    x.welcome()

    Reuslt:
    >> Welcome Bhavya Bindela welcome to the class of 2020
    ```
