# Scope of the variables

Scope of the variable is resolved by LEGB rule in python

L - Local
E - Enclosing function locals
G - Global
B - Built-in

!!! example "Local"

    ```python
    x = 25

    def printer():
        x = 50
        return x

    print(x)
    >> 25

    print(printer())
    >> 50
    ```

!!! example "Local"

    ```python
    # Global
    name = 'THIS IS A GLOBAL STRING'

    def greet():
        # Enclosing
        name = 'Sammy'
        
        def hello():
            # Local
            name = "I'm Local"
            print('Hello '+name)
            
        hello()

    greet()

    Result:
    >> Hello I'm Local
    ```

!!! example "Enclosing function locals"

    ```python
    name = 'THIS IS A GLOBAL STRING'

    def greet():
        name = 'Sammy'
        
        def hello():
            print('Hello '+name)
            
        hello()

    greet()

    Result:
    >> Hello sammy
    ```

!!! example "Global"

    ```python
    name = 'THIS IS A GLOBAL STRING'

    def greet():
        
        def hello():
            print('Hello '+name)
            
        hello()

    greet()

    Result:
    >> Hello THIS IS A GLOBAL STRING
    ```

!!! example "built-in"

    ```python
    >> len
    >> help(len)
    ```

## Global Keyword
Global keyword allows you to modify the variable outside of the current scope.   
It is used to create a global variable and make changes to the variable in a local context.

**The basic rules for global keyword in Python are:**

* When we create a variable inside a function, it is local by default.
* When we define a variable outside of a function, it is global by default. You don't have to use global keyword.
* We use global keyword to read and write a global variable inside a function.
* Use of global keyword outside a function has no effect.

#### Modifying the Global variable from inside the function

!!! example 
  ```python
  c = 1 # global variable
      
  def add():
      c = c + 2 # increment c by 2
      print(c)

  add()

  Result:
  >> UnboundLocalError: local variable 'c' referenced before assignment
  ```

In order to modify the global variable from inside the function, we need to call the global variable inside the function.

!!! example "Modifying the Global variable inside the function"

    ```python
    c = 0 # global variable

    def add():
        global c
        c = c + 2 # increment by 2
        print("Inside add():", c)

    add()
    print("In main:", c)

    Result:
    >> Inside add(): 2
    >> In main: 2
    ```
